## Creating a  Own Token

     This solidity program is a simple "Token creation" program that demonstrates how to create a own token by using the Solidity programming Languages.The purpose of this program is starting point fo those who are new to create a token in solidity and want to get a feel for how it works.
  
## Description
    This program is a simple Contract  written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.The contract has a few functions that uses to mint and burn the tokens in the total supply.This program serves as a simple and straightforward to create our own in Solidity programming, and can be used as a stepping stone for more complex projects in the future.
## Getting Started
## Executing program

    To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

    Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., HelloWorld.sol). Copy and paste the following code into the file:

    To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.9" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Beginnerproject.sol" button.

     Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the " MyToken " contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

     Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by calling the Mint and Burn function. Click on the "MyToken" contract in the left-hand sidebar, and then click on the "mint" and "Burn" function to add and burn token. Finally, click on the "transact" button to execute the function and retrieve the "Balance" or "Total capacity " of the token .
